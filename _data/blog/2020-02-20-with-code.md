## Aging Socially

### Project Type:UI Design, UX Design, Information Design

### Date:Jan-May 2019

### Technologies:Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator

In this project, I worked with other HCI students to understand how seniors think approach social media in order to design a system that allows seniors to engage in social activity. The outcome of this project was the design of a platform with seniors in mind to make social activity easy to find and join.

## The Challenge

An increasing proportion of older people experience feelings of loneliness and social isolation. The results of a 2019 study from the National Institute on Aging showed that feelings of loneliness are directly related to satisfaction with one’s social network. To combat this statistic, this project aims to create an approachable tool for seniors to build their social network and find activities and communities to take part in.\

## Understanding Users

### Observing Users

As part of this project we visited a local senior center to observe how seniors use social media\
We examined that many people:

> Mostly use desktop computers
>
> Are mostly on Facebook
>
> Spend Time Commenting and liking

We then asked the attendants at the center if they had observed anything. They stated that some of the visitors seemed afraid to use the computer or wanted to be guided through a session.

### Interviewing Users

We conducted 1 group interview with 5 participants and 3 individual interviews\
The key findings from the interview are as follows:

> Almost every participant voiced concern about data privacy and the validity of information online.
>
> 3 participants stated that they would like to join a group to be more social rather than try it on their own.
>
> Several participants stated that they feel overwhelmed by the number of emails they get from companies.
>
> Many participants wanted to have fun with their families

From these interviews we developed the following 3 behavioral profiles:

### Open Users

From out interviews we deduced that some users are looking for fun things to do but don't know where to start.

### Informed Users

Some users are primarily concerned with getting information and staying up to date on what's happening in the world and with the people they care about

### Active Users

Some of the people we interviewed have a close group of friends they like to do things with and want to find more events that they can do together

## Ideation

### Low Fidelity Prototyping

We began to refine our sketches into low fidelity prototypes of the app that allowed us to think about the built-out of features and play around with the interactions and ask potential users about their first impressions.

## Hi-Fi Prototype

After we refined a low fidelity prototype we were satisfied with we moved on to prototyping a high fidelity mock up that could give an idea of what the final product might look like and define its specific features. Our product is a social networking site where users can find communities and events to join as well as create their own groups.

### Onboarding

We designed an system that allows users to establish security questions in lieu of providing personal information. Because our users were tired of getting emails and afraid to share personal information this solution could allow a backdoor if they forget their password.

### Quick Tutorial

The overlay shows new users how the system works. This will alleviate some of the stress of learning a new system that our participants expressed. We also would have this in the help section.

### Finding Your People

One of the main pages allows users to find events to attend based on what they are interested in. The same page exists for communities

### Creating Groups

Users can also create groups through a touch/click-to-edit popup UI. Many of out interviewees expressed that they would like to have groups for just their family as well as local organizations.

### MicroInteractions

When creating groups new members can be dynamically added with one click. These small interactions increase the convenience of using our design.

### Group Pages

Once created, users can see the events that that group is hosting or set to attend and any post that may have been made by group members on that group's unique page.

### MicroInteractions

Users are able to share events with their groups or individuals directly through just a few clicks by sending them in a dynamically opened chat window.

## Reflection

This project helped me to understand a lot about the UX design process and how to take an idea and test it out. I think we still would need to test out this product with more seniors and people of all ages to understand if it is useable, learnable, and desirable. Overall I think we made a product with the potential to really help people stay connected and find new and interesting things to do that is approachable for seniors.
