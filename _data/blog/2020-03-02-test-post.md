## A travel site for the city of Copenhagen

Project Type:UX Design, WebDev, Illustration

Date:Sep-Dec 2019

Technologies:Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator

As part of my web technologies class I designed a travel site for the city of Copenhagen. The information on the site is based on my own experience in the city. For this project I adopted the aesthetics of Danish modernism. I also designed a series of illustrations to give the site character. I created a site that provides information, is fun to explore, and captures a sense of Hygge.

## The Prompt

Design an aesthetically pleasing travel site about a city that you have experience with. Include a map widget made with the google-maps api.

## Wireframing and Ideation

Site Components

I envisioned the site having three main sections that mirrored what I would do in my ideal trip to Copenhagen. They were comprised of three main things one does in a city:

* Explore
* Eat
* Excursions

These would make up the main pages and sections of my site design. In my wireframe I explored how to organize and create interactons in these main sections.

Site Map

This sitemap shows the main content of the site.

## Illustrations

Illustrations can quickly showcase information and make the language used in a project more clear. They can also be endearing and add aesthetic charm to a project. I used them in my project to tell uses what kind of content they could expect on each of the three main pages. I also used them to give users something fun to look at and engage with.

Copenhagen

For the home page I wanted to make an illustration that shows the character of the city. I wanted to show the major landmarks and provide something cute and interactive for user. Users can click on the townhomes of Nyhavn and change their color to mimic the bright colors of the harbour in real life. This kind of illustration is meant to endear users to the site and

Explore

I designed another illustration for the 'explore' section of the website which showcases sights around the city. This illustration summarizes some of Copenhagen's biggest sites like The Little Mermaid statue, Tivoli Amusement Park, and the The Church of Our Saviour. This illustration conveys to users that this section is about things to do around the city.

Excursions

This illustration is for the excursions section of the site. I made this convey to users that this section involved travel outside of the city. This illustration can hopefully makes the idea of venturing out of the city feel more approachable.

Eat

This illustration showcases some classic Danish food as an introduction to the section of the site which recommends restaurants. This illustrations shows classic foods like smørrebrød, grod, kaffe, and kringle

## The UI

The UI of the site has three main sections that I designed to provide users with engaging information in a usable format.

Explore

The explore section's main feature is a swipeable carousel that showcases the sights of Copenhage. This allows users to quickly traverse unique locals around the city. This section has multiple controls. It's swipable and it has arrow-controls to navigate between slides. Multiple controls is useful for a site that serves both mobile and desktop users. Swiping can be a difficult action to perform on destkop and swiping is a familiar for users on mobile devices

Excursions

This section details several day trips that users can do when staying in copenhagen. They can scroll through, see how much time it takes to get from place to place, and the average price of a ticket from the city to these places. The images here show the desktop and mobile UI for these sections

Eat

This section shows information about great restaurants arount the city. Users can select a restaurant they want information about and its location is shown on the map and information about the restaurant is presented to the user along with an image. This allows users to get a lot of information abouta restaurant and learn about the city.

## Reflection

This project was a lot of fun. I got to make something cool while reflecting on my time in Copenhagen. I also got to showcase my skills with illustration and UI design. I also learned that illustrations can help bridge any gaps in information that users experience when reading section headings. I also got to focus my design on conveying a holistic aesthetic in the style of Danish modernism. I think I learned a lot and showcased my ability to take designs from sketch to usable interfaces.
