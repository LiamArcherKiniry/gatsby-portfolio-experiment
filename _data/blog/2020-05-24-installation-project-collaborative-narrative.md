## Interactive Storytelling Installation

### Project Type:Installation, WebDev, UI Design, UX Design

### Date:Sep 2019

### Technologies:Javascript, PHP, CSS, HTML

Our team designed and created an interactive installation that encouraged people come together and build a story. This project was part of the Transnational Workshop: Digital Creation Beyond the Screen. I was involved in the ideation, design, and development of the final product.

## The Challenge

### The Experience of Story Telling and Exhibition

In this project, I worked with a team of multidisciplinary students RIT and Université Paris 8, during a week-long stay in Paris, to create an interactive digital art installation. As part of the Center for Engaged Storycraft we were interested in how people share stories across cultures. We wanted to encourage people to come together to engage and interact in a physical space to tell stories together.

## Ideation

### The Space

Designing an installation meant that we had to think about the user experience of space. We drafted several iterations of a design for the space, all of which included two separate points of interaction for users.![Sketches of possible layouts for the room depicting a table and a large projection screen](https://liamkiniry.site/assets/images/parisproject/layoutIdeation.png)

### Coming Together

When we were told we would only have access to one computer for the installation space it was a blessing in disguise. When we play-tested interactions on just one interface, the intimacy created a much more collaborative atmosphere. People talked, reached over one-another, and even touched.

## The Design

### Design Inspiration

We were inspired by the paper cutout silhouettes used in early french and german silent films. These were simple to create and the black silhouettes made the drawings universal and allowed people to imagine how the characters would look.

### Design Sample

We emulated the silhouette style we were inspired by and used playing-card UI elements to create a game-like atmosphere and to tie into users' mental models of game playing.

## The UI

### Creating the Story

Users first begin selecting the elements of their story while these selections are projected in an animation in real time for the entire room to see. A select and confirm two-step interaction allows user to change their selection before submitting.

### The Display

While only the users can see the choices they are making, these choices become elements on an animation that is projected and shown to everyone in the room.

## The Prototype

### Overview

A playthrough of the final Prototype can be seen here these show the how users would interact with the prototype in the installation the video above shows users input and the video below shows what happens on the screen that is projected or all visitors to see.

### Users' Experience

We installed our project in Tour Montparnasse and invited people to come and play with it.

## Reflection

This project was a great learning experience. I really benefited from working with people who have such a diverse range of skills and experiences. We were able to communicate across language barriers and skill sets. We were given a week to construct and install the project so it was an exercise in scale and time management. In the end, we ended up creating a functional proof of concept. In the future, we will extend the project beyond a minimum viable prototype. We plan to scale this project up in the future and make it available to travel.
