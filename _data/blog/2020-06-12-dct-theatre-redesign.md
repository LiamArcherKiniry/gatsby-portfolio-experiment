## Downstairs Cabaret Theatre Redesign

### Project Type:UI Design, UX Design, Information Design, Web Development

### Date:Jan-Mar 2020

### Technologies: Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Illustrator

In this project, I worked with a team UX designers and developers to redesign the branding and website of a local theatre organization. We sought to organize the information architecture of the site, revamp the user experience of buying tickets and getting information, and improve the likelihood of donations by focusing on calls to action.

## Why Redesign?

The  organizations existing site had some issues with information architecture and users had trouble finding the information they were looking for. There were also some dated styles and issues with responsive design that we sought to address. 

Our main goals were

* Business Rebranding
* Content Organization
* Content Presentation
* Call-to-action Emphasis
* Improve Functionality

  The existing site can be seen here:

## Understanding the Site

### Site Structure

In order to better understand the content and structure of the site we conducted a card sort so that potential users could categorize the site's content in an intuitive way. The results of the card sort on the site's content were used to create a new site map and organize the project.

### Old Site Map

### New Site Map

## Understanding Users

As part of this project we spoke to the owner of the theatre and supporters of the theatre. From these conversations we developed the following personas. 

### Supporters of the Theatre

### Explorer

### Theatre Staff

## Ideation

### Low Fidelity Prototyping

We began to refine our sketches into low fidelity prototypes of the app that allowed us to think about the built-out of features and play around with the interactions and ask potential users about their first impressions.

## Hi-Fi Prototype

After we refined a low fidelity prototype we were satisfied with we moved on to prototyping a high fidelity mock up that could give an idea of what the final product might look like and define its specific features. Our product is a social networking site where users can find communities and events to join as well as create their own groups.

### Onboarding

We designed an system that allows users to establish security questions in lieu of providing personal information. Because our users were tired of getting emails and afraid to share personal information this solution could allow a backdoor if they forget their password.

### Quick Tutorial

The overlay shows new users how the system works. This will alleviate some of the stress of learning a new system that our participants expressed. We also would have this in the help section.

### Finding Your People

One of the main pages allows users to find events to attend based on what they are interested in. The same page exists for communities

### Creating Groups

Users can also create groups through a touch/click-to-edit popup UI. Many of out interviewees expressed that they would like to have groups for just their family as well as local organizations.

### MicroInteractions

When creating groups new members can be dynamically added with one click. These small interactions increase the convenience of using our design.

### Group Pages

Once created, users can see the events that that group is hosting or set to attend and any post that may have been made by group members on that group's unique page.

### MicroInteractions

Users are able to share events with their groups or individuals directly through just a few clicks by sending them in a dynamically opened chat window.

## Reflection

This project helped me to understand a lot about the UX design process and how to take an idea and test it out. I think we still would need to test out this product with more seniors and people of all ages to understand if it is useable, learnable, and desirable. Overall I think we made a product with the potential to really help people stay connected and find new and interesting things to do that is approachable for seniors.
