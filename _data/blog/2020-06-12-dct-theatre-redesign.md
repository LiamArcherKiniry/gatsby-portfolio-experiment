## Downstairs Cabaret Theatre Redesign

### Project Type:UI Design, UX Design, Information Design, Web Development

### Date:Jan-Mar 2020

### Technologies: Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Illustrator

In this project, I worked with a team UX designers and developers to redesign the branding and website of a local theatre organization. We sought to organize the information architecture of the site, revamp the user experience of buying tickets and getting information, and improve the likelihood of donations by focusing on calls to action.

## Why Redesign?

The  organizations existing site had some issues with information architecture and users had trouble finding the information they were looking for. There were also some dated styles and issues with responsive design that we sought to address. 

Our main goals were

* Business Rebranding
* Content Organization
* Content Presentation
* Call-to-action Emphasis
* Improve Functionality

  The existing site can be seen here:

## Understanding the Site

### Site Structure

In order to better understand the content and structure of the site we conducted a card sort so that potential users could categorize the site's content in an intuitive way. The results of the card sort on the site's content were used to create a new site map and organize the project.

### Old Site Map

### New Site Map

## Understanding Users

As part of this project we spoke to the owner of the theatre and supporters of the theatre. From these conversations we developed the following personas. 

### Supporters of the Theatre

### Explorer

### Theatre Staff

## Ideation

### Wireframing and Prototyping

We began to refine our sketches into prototypes of the design that allowed us to think about the built-out of features.

### Branding

Part of our project was to redesign the branding of the site. To this end, I designed a logo, illustrations, and a color scheme. I chose red as the main color of the theme and the curved elements of the site to represent the red velvet curtains of the theatre's stage. I also made an illustration to showcase the new brand of the DCT and explain what the theatre offers quickly to users as soon as they land on the page.

## The Design

The final design had a home page, an about page, a support page, a page highlighting all the upcoming shows, and a page about visiting the theatre.

### The Home Page

The home page includes a section with the title and illustration, a section showing upcoming shows, a section explaining what the theatre does, a section soliciting support for the theatre, and a section about planning a visit to the theatre

### The Shows Page

The shows page displays the shows that are being put on by the theatre and offers information about the kinds of things they do so users can think about events that may come in the future.

The visit page shows a map with the location of the theatre, upcoming shows, and amenities the theatre offers.

### The Member Portal

The member portal offers theatre members a location to view and manage their member benefits. The theatre's members wanted a location that made their benefits clear and allowed them to manage their free tickets and renew their package.

## Reflection

This project allowed me to work with a team of developers and designers to service a local organization. We got to communicate with out client, establish their needs, and develop a work plan. I also learned how to convey designs from prototype to development and make requirements clear. I learned a lot about working with a client and had a lot of fun.
